# Project 2: Identifying Key Predictors of Smoking Abstinence through Lasso Regression and Best Subset Modeling

## Overview

This project, in collaboration with Dr. George Papandonatos from Brown Universityâ€™s Biostatistics Department, explores factors impacting smoking cessation in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). 
In our analysis, we examined baseline characteristics as potential moderators of treatment effects on end-of-treatment abstinence, applying Lasso and Best Subset regression models to uncover key predictors. 

## Data

The trial enrolled 300 adult smokers with current or past MDD, who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: varenicline with behavioral activation for smoking cessation (BASC), varenicline with standard treatment (ST), placebo with BASC, or placebo with ST. BASC is a behavioral approach that aims to increase engagement in rewarding, non-smoking-related activities to counteract depressive symptoms, while ST focuses on general smoking cessation counseling without targeted behavioral activation. 

Variables in this data include demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity), nicotine dependence indicators (such as the FTCD score and Nicotine Metabolism Ratio [NMR]), and psychological variables (including the Beck Depression Depression Inventory [BDI] score and readiness to quit).
